Caesar Cipher
This Python code encrypts and decrypts text using a Caesar cipher.
How it works
The Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher that shifts each letter in the alphabet by a certain number of places. For example, if the key is 3, then 'A' would be encrypted as 'D', 'B' would be encrypted as 'E', and so on.
The code provided includes two functions:
encrypt(text, key): This function takes a text string and a key as input, and returns the encrypted text.
decrypt(text, key): This function takes an encrypted text string and a key as input, and returns the decrypted text.
Additional notes
The Caesar cipher is a very simple cipher and can be easily broken. It should not be used for any serious security purposes.
The code provided can be easily modified to support other types of ciphers.
